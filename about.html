        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <p>This game was generated through a series of prompts given to OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT. The game is a humorous take on the academic journey, offering players choices that lead to one of four ironic endings.</p>
        <p>The prompts used to generate this game are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>"I want you to write me a web game using html, css, and javascript. The game is a choose your own adventure set in academia. Its tone should be ironic."</li>
            <li>"The starting options should be 'Undergrad,' 'Graduate Student,' 'Tenure Track Faculty.' At some point the player must be asked to choose an academic discipline from the list 'Physics,' 'Biology,' 'Computer Science,' 'Fine Arts'."</li>
            <li>"The possible endings are 'Appointed Provost,' 'Died of Dysentery,' 'Work for a startup,' and 'Get another PhD?'. You will generate the other choice points in the game based on funny, ironic, slightly mean stereotypes of those degrees. There should be at least 3 choice points and no more than 5 before the ending."</li>
            <li>"Keep going from where you left off."</li>
            <li>"How do I run this in my browser?"</li>
            <li>"Give me just the game.js code again."</li>
            <li>"Give it the title 'ChatGPT Generated Academic Choose Your Own Adventure' and create an About page linked from the main page that includes all the prompts used to this point. Do not include the code generated."</li>
            <li>"Keep going."</li>
            <li>"Include the full prompts in the About page. Do not truncate."</li>
        </ol>
